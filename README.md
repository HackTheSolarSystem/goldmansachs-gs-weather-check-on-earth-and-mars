### Goal
* To achieve Real-Time Data Visualization on OpenSpace 
* To provide OnDemand Data Visualization on OpenSpace

### Approach
End-to-End Solution includes the following:
* Image Recorder - Watch for new weather images of the planet from Solar Systems and records the image, date and time 
* Image Processer - Imaging Library that processes any images to .tiff 
* Image Transformer - Georeferenced images transformed to global GDAL virtual dataset 
* OpenSpace GlobeBrowsing Visualization - GDAL dataset OpenSpace GlobeBrowsing Visualization
* OnDemand Visualization - Strategic solution for onDemand Visualization 

### Challenges
OpenSpace GlobeBrowsing Visualization with new geo.tiff/GDAL datasets
Image Transformation to GDAL VRT

### Tech Stack
* Python Flask Framework [FLASK]
* Python Imaging Library [PILLOW]
* Python URL Libraries [URLLIB]
* Watchdog Observers [WATCHDOG]
* Python shutil - high-level File Operations [SHUTIL]
* GDAL Virtual Dataset 
* OpenSpace

### Future Path
* Dataset Caching
* Large Datasets hosting/streaming from a Server   
* Hadoop Integration for reliable large data processing , high-bandwidth streaming
      
### Lessons Learnt
* OpenSpace
* Geo spatial dataset visualization
* Technology impact on science challenges
