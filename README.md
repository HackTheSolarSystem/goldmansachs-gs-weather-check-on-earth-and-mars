# GS@HackTheSolar: Real-Time Weather on Earth and Mars

# Approach
Enterprise Solution includes the following:
1> Image Recorder - Watch for new weather images of the planet from Solar Systems and records the image, date and time 
2> Image Processer - Imaging Library that processes any images to .tiff 
3> Image Transformer - Georeferenced images transformed to global GDAL virtual dataset 
4> OpenSpace GlobeBrowsing Visualization - GDAL dataset OpenSpace GlobeBrowsing Visualization
5> OnDemand Visualization - Strategic solution for onDemand Visualization
